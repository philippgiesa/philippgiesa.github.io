Hi, I'm Philipp. When I'm not working on my newest hobby - building small devices like an outdoor air-quality-sensor with a Raspberry Pi - I like to play the Piano, do various sports (fitness, biking, skatebording) and play computer games.


### Why I am (not) qualified to write about the stuff in this blog 
I studied economics, social and political science at the University of Cologne and the University of Edinburgh. During and after my studies, I've worked in academia as a research and teaching assistent.

Two years after graduating, I started working as a Data Scientist at a large retail group. I continously improved in my analytical and technical capabilities. I've set-up cloud infrastructure from scrath with infrastructure-as-code, written and deployed web apps and scheduled (ETL) Workflows with Airflow. I work in a cross-functional team with data engineers, frontend developer and DevOps colleagues and we develop and maintain a large data product.

So, I do know something about coding, less so about hardware and electronics. It's fun though. :)
